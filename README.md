## Docpile UI

This project is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [React Router 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A local version of this app can be run by cloning the repository, installing dependencies (by running `npm install`), and then running `npm start`.

This runs the app locally on a development server with live reloading. To generate a production build use `npm run build`.

##### Currently in progress: building out and testing API integration.
